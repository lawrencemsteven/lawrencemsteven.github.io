Bulletopia was my first Unity project and this was a solo project.

{{< youtubeLite id="wbTHAv40LPQ" label="Bulletopia Demo" params="rel=0">}}

Here, I made a simple shooter that as the game went on, the player would collect upgrade points to buff their character. They buffs are as follows:
1. Shooting Speed
2. Reload Speed
3. Bullet Damage
4. Ammo Count
5. Walking Speed
6. Jump Height

There was also three weapons that were unlockable for the player:
1. Pistol (Starter Weapon)
2. Submachine Gun
3. Assault Rifle

This project provided me with a very good understanding of how to use Unity and some of the tools that it provided.
