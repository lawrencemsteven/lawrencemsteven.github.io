This project was created on a team with two other people. One artist, one musician, and I was the programmer. This game was pretty fun to work on since I got to create a few new systems.

One of the systems that I created was an inventory system. It was a lot more challenging than I origionally imagined and proved to be one of the most challenging things for this project. There were different types of inventory slots so that the furnace for example would only take anything that could be cooked in the top slot and only take fuel in the bottom slot. I also wanted to include the basic features such as item sorting and item stacking.
