summary: "Four player space ship battler"

This was my freshman design project at Drexel. This project was made over two quarters so there was a total of 20 weeks.

In this game four players will split up and have to take control of their ship. There are four rooms within the ship, Shields, Oxygen Generator, Weapon, and Printer. The printer will make the supplies needed for each of the other rooms.
