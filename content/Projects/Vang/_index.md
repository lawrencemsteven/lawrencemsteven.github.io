### Vang is a Ray-Marching Voxel Engine developed by me!

{{< github repo="lawrencemsteven/vang" >}}

Development started in November 2022 and has been going strong ever since. I have been able use the engine for my bachelor's thesis for my 2024 graduation from Drexel University.

Here are a few showcases of some of the engine's features:
