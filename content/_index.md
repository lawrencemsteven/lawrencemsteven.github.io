I am a computer graphics engineer with a passion for real-time rendering and game engine development. I mainly have experience with C++, OpenGL, and Vulkan. Currently, I am working on an open-source game engine, [Vang]({{< ref "Projects/Vang" >}}), that utilizes ray marching inside large, realistic, cuboid environments. Originally coming from a game development background, I have extensively worked with various commercial game engines such as Unity, Unreal, and GameMaker. I hope to use my experience to develop tools that make creating immersive environments more streamlined and accessible to everyone.
