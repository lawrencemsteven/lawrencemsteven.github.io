I am a computer graphics engineer with a passion for real-time rendering and game engine development. I am mainly experienced with C++, OpenGL, and Vulkan. Currently, I'm working on an open-source game engine, [Vang]({{< ref "Projects/Vang" >}}), that utilizes ray marching inside large, realistic, cuboid environments. Originally coming from a game development background, I also have extensively worked with various commercial game engines such as Unity, Unreal, and GameMaker. I hope to use my experiences to develop tools that make graphics programming more streamlined and accessible to everyone.
