I have been able use the engine for my bachelor\u0026rsquo;s thesis for my 2024 graduation from Drexel University. The goal of the paper is to is to demonstrate a more efficient to ray-march a large voxel scene than traditional methods such as using a voxel octree or standard plane-assisted ray marching.\nHere are a few showcases of some of the engine\u0026rsquo;s features:\n","date":"April 25 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"stevenml.com/projects/vang/","section":"Projects","summary":"Voxel Abstraction Engine","title":"Vang","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"March 21 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"stevenml.com/projects/unity/","section":"Projects","summary":"Quick Prototypes","title":"Unity","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"January 9 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"stevenml.com/projects/gamemaker/","section":"Projects","summary":"Various 2D Pixel Projects","title":"GameMaker Studio","type":"projects"},{"content":"\rPlay Here The goal of this project was to see how close to a finished game I could get within a week of time.\nThe game is a simple matching game where the player must make a match of four cards in order to get their bonus. Then they can try to match some of the other cards!\nThere is a total of 6 cards in the game that correspond to health, dodge, attack, poison, block, and regeneration. The effects would stack for each card that the player would get.\nOne of the most important things that I had to realize for this assignment is that I did not have a lot of time to work on this. I needed to find what was going to give me the most benefit for the least amount of time. For this I decided to work on the animations for the cards such as the card shuffling and card flipping. It seems small but I think it really helps to boost the overall look and polish of the game. The animations were entirely programmatic so it was fun to use math to try and generate animations. This is one of the first times that I have tried this outside of my animation class.\n","date":"January 9 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"stevenml.com/projects/gamemaker/thematchine/","section":"Projects","summary":"Card Matching game made solo in a week","title":"The MATCHine","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"October 1 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"stevenml.com/projects/animation/","section":"Projects","summary":"Maya and Blender Projects","title":"Modeling \u0026 Animation","type":"projects"},{"content":"This project served as an way to learn to Unreal Engine 5. The goal was to setup a simple cave generation algorithm. Here is a demo showcasing the end result:\nThere was a total of 17 possible layouts for the caves to generate within a 3D hexagonal grid layout. Here is an image of all the possible layouts:\nThe blue number corresponds to the nunber of entries to the rooms. The red number is just an index. The engine will start with one enterance on one side and then connects to another room type. It also supports traveling vertically within the 3D space as well. This system was meant for a game where each segment could be handcrafted as some cave segment then each of the pieces can be stitched together to have some random generation with individual hand-crafted rooms.\nOverall, the project was a great introduction to Unreal Engine and I really enjoyed working with their blueprint system. I had a lot of fun just making sure that it looked clean and was easily readable through functions.\nLastly, I did also get to experiment with creating some of my own blueprint functions in C++ since they were just too complicated for blueprint alone. I was surprised with how easy it was to handle data between each and it is pretty interesting to see how blueprint can be very user friendly and simple for people to prototype in. Meanwhile, you can still have people in the backend working on individual blueprint components for anything too complicated or performance heavy.\n","date":"June 8 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"stevenml.com/projects/unreal/cavegeneration/","section":"Projects","summary":"Use Blueprint and C++ to generate a cave system for a game.","title":"Cave Generation","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"June 8 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"stevenml.com/projects/unreal/","section":"Projects","summary":"Try out blueprint and C++","title":"Unreal Engine","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"January 14 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"stevenml.com/projects/other/","section":"Projects","summary":"A few other miscellaneous projects","title":"Other","type":"projects"},{"content":"\rPlay Here This project was created on a team with two other people. One artist, one musician, and I was the programmer. This game was pretty fun to work on since I got to create a few new systems.\nOne of the systems that I created was an inventory system. It was a lot more challenging than I origionally imagined and proved to be one of the most challenging things for this project. There were different types of inventory slots so that the furnace for example would only take anything that could be cooked in the top slot and only take fuel in the bottom slot. I also wanted to include the basic features such as item sorting and item stacking.\n","date":"November 2 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"stevenml.com/projects/gamemaker/metallicrops/","section":"Projects","summary":"Survival matallic plant growing game","title":"Metallicrops Prototype","type":"projects"},{"content":"This was my freshman design project at Drexel.
