Throughout their time managing the restaurant, the player will be able to make upgrades to their stations and add different designs to the restaurant. Everything that the player does must be done to the beat, from flipping pancakes to washing dishes.\nThis project was made as part of a 12 person team for Junior design project 2 at Drexel. I was the producer on the team and I mostly managed the programming team as well as the documentation. Towards the end of our project I also worked on a lot of the polish work for the project such as the menus, screen transitions, and shop.\nProbably the most important tool that I created for the team was an interpolation library called Interpolawrence. This was meant to give smooth or fast transitions to any zero to one value. I used this for our games camera transitions in the menu. It is also used on the individual menu transitions when the screens slide from top to bottom. Even the egg dancing animation is run using the same interpolating functions.\npublic class Interpolawrence : MonoBehaviour { public enum InterpolawrenceSpeeds { Quick, Slow } public static float Lerp(InterpolawrenceSpeeds startSpeed, InterpolawrenceSpeeds stopSpeed, float amount) { if (startSpeed == InterpolawrenceSpeeds.Slow \u0026amp;\u0026amp; stopSpeed == InterpolawrenceSpeeds.Slow) { float transitionAmount = Mathf.Lerp(0.0f, Mathf.PI, amount); return 0.5f * Mathf.Sin(transitionAmount - Mathf.PI / 2.0f) + 0.5f; } else if (startSpeed == InterpolawrenceSpeeds.Quick \u0026amp;\u0026amp; stopSpeed == InterpolawrenceSpeeds.Quick) { float transitionAmount = Mathf.Lerp(0.0f, Mathf.PI, amount); if (transitionAmount \u0026lt; 0.5f) { return Mathf.Sin(transitionAmount) * 0.5f; } else { return Mathf.Abs(Mathf.Sin(transitionAmount) * 0.5f - 1.0f); } } else if (startSpeed == InterpolawrenceSpeeds.Slow \u0026amp;\u0026amp; stopSpeed == InterpolawrenceSpeeds.Quick) { float transitionAmount = Mathf.Lerp(0.0f, Mathf.PI / 2.0f, amount); return Mathf.Sin(transitionAmount - Mathf.PI / 2.0f) + 1.0f; } else if (startSpeed == InterpolawrenceSpeeds.Quick \u0026amp;\u0026amp; stopSpeed == InterpolawrenceSpeeds.Slow) { float transitionAmount = Mathf.Lerp(0.0f, Mathf.PI / 2.0f, amount); return Mathf.Sin(transitionAmount); } return -1.0f; } } Beat Flavor: Breakfast Boogie was definitely difficult to work on such a large team and within such a short time span being only 10 weeks. However, I really enjoyed working with this team and I am happy with our end result.\n","date":"March 21 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"stevenml.com/projects/unity/bfbb/","section":"Projects","summary":"Serve up rhythm, make an unbeatable flavor","title":"Beat Flavor: Breakfast Boogie","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"March 21 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"stevenml.com/projects/unity/","section":"Projects","summary":"Game Design Projects","title":"Unity","type":"projects"},{"content":"\rJjman739/InsiderPerspective\rC# 0\r0\rDownload Insider Perspective involves a camera technician who is working as a CCTV personnel inside the esteemed megabucks manor, looking to get the money he\u0026rsquo;s owed.

I was the producer on the team organizing team operations and fascilitating communication with our publisher the professor. I also worked on the different camera shaders that were featured in the game. Here is some examples of what was available:\nI was happy to get to work on the camera shaders. All of them are image space shaders that just change the resulting image in some way. For example, the inverted one just inverts all the colors in the image. It was a fun introduction to working with shaders within Unity.\nI also enjoyed being the producer on the team. This mean that I had to keep our GitHub organized as well as keep assigned tasks in order. This was my first time as a producer but I enjoyed the challenge and enjoyed making sure everyone was happy to work on the game!\n","date":"December 18 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"stevenml.com/projects/unity/insiderperspective/","section":"Projects","summary":"It helps to have eyes on the inside","title":"Insider Perspective","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"January 9 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"stevenml.com/projects/gamemaker/","section":"Projects","summary":"Various 2D Pixel Projects","title":"GameMaker Studio","type":"projects"},{"content":"\rPlay Here The goal of this project was to see how close to a finished game I could get within a week of time.\nThe game is a simple matching game where the player must make a match of four cards in order to get their bonus.

The effects would stack for each card that the player would get.\nOne of the most important things that I had to realize for this assignment is that I did not have a lot of time to work on this. I needed to find what was going to give me the most benefit for the least amount of time. For this I decided to work on the animations for the cards such as the card shuffling and card flipping. It seems small but I think it really helps to boost the overall look and polish of the game. The animations were entirely programmatic so it was fun to use math to try and generate animations.

Here is a demo showcasing the end result:\nThere was a total of 17 possible layouts for the caves to generate within a 3D hexagonal grid layout. Here is an image of all the possible layouts:\nThe blue number corresponds to the nunber of entries to the rooms. The red number is just an index. The engine will start with one enterance on one side and then connects to another room type. It also supports traveling vertically within the 3D space as well. This system was meant for a game where each segment could be handcrafted as some cave segment then each of the pieces can be stitched together to have some random generation with individual hand-crafted rooms.\nOverall, the project was a great introduction to Unreal Engine and I really enjoyed working with their blueprint system. I had a lot of fun just making sure that it looked clean and was easily readable through functions.\nLastly, I did also get to experiment with creating some of my own blueprint functions in C++ since they were just too complicated for blueprint alone. I was surprised with how easy it was to handle data between each and it is pretty interesting to see how blueprint can be very user friendly and simple for people to prototype in. Meanwhile, you can still have people in the backend working on individual blueprint components for anything too complicated or performance heavy.\n","date":"June 8 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"stevenml.com/projects/unreal/cavegeneration/","section":"Projects","summary":"Use Blueprint and C++ to generate a cave system for a game.","title":"Cave Generation","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"June 8 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"stevenml.com/projects/unreal/","section":"Projects","summary":"Try out blueprint and C++","title":"Unreal Engine","type":"projects"},{"content":"While at Drexel, I took a course on 3D modeling.
